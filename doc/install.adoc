= JaCaMo Installation
:toc: right

ifdef::env-github[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

We have different options to start using JaCaMo: using Eclipse, shell script commands, Gradle, or Docker. Eclipse and shell script options require that you download and install JaCaMo in your machine.

== Eclipse Plugin

Requirements:

- Java >= 8
- Eclipse Java-EE or Committers >= Juno

To get started, follow the http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/eclipseplugin/tutorial/[JaCaMo eclipse plugin] instructions until step 12. The steps 13 to 17 illustrate how to create and run a new application.

== Shell commands scripts

You can download JaCaMo from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacamo/files/version-0[here], unzip it, and use some useful scripts. To configure these scripts:


. Make sure you have `JACAMO_HOME` properly set (this variable points to a directory with  subdirectories `libs` and `scripts` of JaCaMo), then setup the `PATH`:

    export PATH=$JACAMO_HOME/scripts:$PATH

. Ensure you have `JDK_HOME` properly set (this variable points to a Java Development Kit (JDK) directory)

. Configure JaCaMo with
+
----
    java -jar $JACAMO_HOME/libs/jacamo-XXXX.jar
----
replacing XXXX by the release number.

Available scripts:

. *Create* a new application identified by `helloworld` with
+
----
jacamo-new-project ../somewhere/helloworld
----
Examples of agent, artifact and organization are placed in the `src` folder.


. And *run* it with
+
    jacamo ../somewhere/helloworld/helloworld.jcm


. To create a single jar file with all resources to run the application:
+
----
jacamo-jar helloworld.jcm
----
that can be run by
+
----
java -jar helloworld.jar
----

== Gradle

Requirements:

- Java >= 8
- Gradle

You have to install https://gradle.org[Gradle] on your computer and then run the following commands to create a new application (JaCaMo will be downloaded by the script):
-----
curl -s http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/nps/npss.sh -o np.sh
sh ./np.sh
-----

NOTE: `npss.sh` creates an application based on the JaCaMo SnapShot version. You can replace it by `np07.sh` to create a JaCaMo application based on version 0.7.

You will be asked to enter the identification of the application and then instructions about how to run the application will be shown.

If you want to run a JaCaMo application that was not created with a `build.gradle` file, you can download a template from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacamo-lang/jacamo/master/src/main/resources/templates/build.gradle[here] and replace

-  `<VERSION>` by the required JaCaMo release (e.g. `0.7-SNAPSHOT`)
- `<PROJECT-FILE>` by your .jcm file (e.g. `hello.jcm`).

== Docker

Requirements:

- https://github.com/jacamo-lang/docker[Docker] installed

See link:https://github.com/jacamo-lang/docker[JaCaMo-Docker page] for instructions on how to create and run JaCaMo application using Docker images.

== Atom

For an IDE lighter than Eclipse, we recommend https://atom.io[Atom]. The following packages provide syntax highlight for AgentSpeak (the Jason language) and JCM projects: https://atom.io/packages/language-jcm[language-jcm] and https://atom.io/packages/language-agentspeak[language-agentspeak].
