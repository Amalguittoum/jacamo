:toc: right

ifdef::env-github[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

We have different options to start using JaCaMo: using Eclipse or shell commands.

== Eclipse Plugin

To get started, follow the http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/eclipseplugin/tutorial/[JaCaMo eclipse plugin] instructions until step 12. The steps 13 to 17 illustrate how to create a new project.

== Shell command

You have to install https://gradle.org[Gradle] on your computer and then run the following command to create a new project (JaCaMo will be downloaded by the script):
-----
curl -s http://jacamo.sf.net/lv/np.sh | sh
-----

If you use https://atom.io[Atom], the following packages provide syntax highlight for AgentSpeak (the Jason language) and JCM projects: https://atom.io/packages/language-jcm[language-jcm] and https://atom.io/packages/language-agentspeak[language-agentspeak].

=== Scripts

You can download JaCaMo from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacamo/files/version-0[here], unzip it, and use some useful scripts. To configure these scripts:


. Make sure you have `JACAMO_HOME` properly set (this variable points to a directory with  subdirectories `libs` and `scripts` of JaCaMo), then setup the `PATH`:

    export PATH=$JACAMO_HOME/scripts:$PATH

. Ensure you have `JDK_HOME` properly set (this variable points to a Java Development Kit (JDK) directory)

Available scripts:

. Create a new project with
+
----
jacamo-new-project ../somewhere/helloworld
----
Examples of agent, artifact and organization are placed in the `src` folder.


. And run it with
+
    jacamo ../somewhere/helloworld/helloworld.jcm


. Creates a single jar file with all resources to run the application
+
----
jacamo-jar some.jcm
----
the application can then be run by
+
----
java -jar some.jar
----
