= JaCaMo Installation
:toc: right

ifdef::env-github[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

We have different options to start using JaCaMo: Eclipse, shell script commands, Gradle, or Docker.

Eclipse and shell script options require that you download and install JaCaMo in your machine.
Since the shell script, Gradle, and Docker options do not include an IDE, you can either import the project into an Eclipse workspace (instructions are shown by the creation script) or use some text editor (we suggest Atom, see below).

== Eclipse Plugin

Requirements:

- Java >= 8
- Eclipse Java-EE or Committers >= Photon Release (4.8.0)

To get started, follow the http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/eclipseplugin/tutorial/[JaCaMo eclipse plugin] instructions until step 12. The steps 13 to 17 illustrate how to create and run a new application.

To include existing projects in your eclipse workspace, preferably use the option "file/import/import gradle project". 

== Gradle

Requirements:

- Java >= 8
- Gradle

You have to install https://gradle.org[Gradle] on your computer and then run the following commands to create a new application (the first time you run them, it takes a while to finish since it downloads JaCaMo first):
-----
curl -s -O http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/nps/np07.gradle
gradle -b np07.gradle --console=plain
-----

NOTE: `np07.gradle` creates an application based on JaCaMo 0.7. You can replace it by `npss.gradle` to create a JaCaMo application based on the current snap shot version. https://curl.haxx.se[`curl`] is a program that simply downloads the `np07.gradle` file from http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/nps/np07.gradle.

You will be asked to enter the identification of the application and then instructions about how to run it will be shown.

Example of output:
----
> Task :run
JaCaMo 0.7 built on Mon Oct 01 20:50:56 BRT 2018

Enter the identification of the new application: bobob
Creating path /Users/jomi/tmp/bobob

You can run your application with:
   $ cd /Users/jomi/tmp/bobob
   $ gradle -q --console=plain

an eclipse project can be created from menu File/Import,
option 'Existing Gradle Project'.
----

If you want to run a JaCaMo application that was not created with a `build.gradle` file, you can download a template from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacamo-lang/jacamo/master/src/main/resources/templates/build.gradle[here] and replace

- `<VERSION>` by the required JaCaMo release (e.g. `0.7`)
- `<PROJECT-FILE>` by your .jcm file (e.g. `hello.jcm`).


== Shell commands scripts

Requirements:

- Java >= 8


You can download JaCaMo from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacamo/files/version-0[here], unzip it, and then use scripts to create and run applications. To configure these scripts:


. Make sure you have `JACAMO_HOME` properly set (this variable points to a directory with  subdirectories `libs` and `scripts` of JaCaMo), then setup the `PATH`:

    export PATH=$JACAMO_HOME/scripts:$PATH

. Ensure you have `JDK_HOME` properly set (this variable points to a Java Development Kit (JDK) directory)


Available scripts:

. *Create* a new application identified by `helloworld` with
+
----
jacamo-new-project ../somewhere/helloworld
----
Examples of agent, artifact and organization are placed in the `src` folder. If the application name is not informed, the user is asked to provide one. A second, optional, argument is `--console` and creates an application where the messages are printed in the console instead of opening the MAS Console GUI.


. *Compile* and *run* an application with
+
    jacamo ../somewhere/helloworld/helloworld.jcm

. *Run* an application with
+
    jacamo-run ../somewhere/helloworld/helloworld.jcm


. To create a single jar file with all resources to run the application:
+
----
jacamo-jar helloworld.jcm
----
that can be run by
+
----
java -jar helloworld.jar
----

== Docker

Requirements:

- https://github.com/jacamo-lang/docker[Docker]

See link:https://github.com/jacamo-lang/docker[JaCaMo-Docker page] for instructions on how to create and run JaCaMo application using Docker images.

== Atom

For an IDE lighter than Eclipse, we recommend https://atom.io[Atom]. The following packages provide syntax highlight for AgentSpeak (the Jason language) and JCM projects: https://atom.io/packages/language-jcm[language-jcm] and https://atom.io/packages/language-agentspeak[language-agentspeak].
