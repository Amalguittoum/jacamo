= JaCaMo Installation
:toc: right

ifdef::env-github[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

We have different options to start using JaCaMo: using Eclipse, shell commands, or Docker.

== Eclipse Plugin

Requirements:

- Java >= 8
- Eclipse Java-EE or Committers >= Juno

To get started, follow the http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/eclipseplugin/tutorial/[JaCaMo eclipse plugin] instructions until step 12. The steps 13 to 17 illustrate how to create and run a new project.

== Shell command

Requirements:

- Java >= 8
- Gradle

You have to install https://gradle.org[Gradle] on your computer and then run the following commands to create a new project (JaCaMo will be downloaded by the script):
-----
curl -s http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/nps/npss.sh -o np.sh
sh ./np.sh
-----

NOTE: `npss.sh` creates a project based on the JaCaMo SnapShot version. You can replace it by `np07.sh` to create a JaCaMo project based on version 0.7.

You will be asked to enter the identification of the project and then instructions about how to run the application will be shown.

If you use https://atom.io[Atom], the following packages provide syntax highlight for AgentSpeak (the Jason language) and JCM projects: https://atom.io/packages/language-jcm[language-jcm] and https://atom.io/packages/language-agentspeak[language-agentspeak].

=== Scripts

You can download JaCaMo from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacamo/files/version-0[here], unzip it, and use some useful scripts. To configure these scripts:


. Make sure you have `JACAMO_HOME` properly set (this variable points to a directory with  subdirectories `libs` and `scripts` of JaCaMo), then setup the `PATH`:

    export PATH=$JACAMO_HOME/scripts:$PATH

. Ensure you have `JDK_HOME` properly set (this variable points to a Java Development Kit (JDK) directory)

. Configure JaCaMo with
+
----
    java -jar $JACAMO_HOME/libs/jacamo-XXXX.jar
----
replacing XXXX by the release number.

Available scripts:

. Create a new project with
+
----
jacamo-new-project ../somewhere/helloworld
----
Examples of agent, artifact and organization are placed in the `src` folder.


. And run it with
+
    jacamo ../somewhere/helloworld/helloworld.jcm


. Creates a single jar file with all resources to run the application
+
----
jacamo-jar some.jcm
----
the application can then be run by
+
----
java -jar some.jar
----

== Docker

Requirements:

- https://github.com/jacamo-lang/docker[Docker] installed

See link:https://github.com/jacamo-lang/docker[JaCaMo-Docker page] for instructions on how to create and run JaCaMo application using Docker images.
